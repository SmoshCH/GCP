# My Study Guide:
● Basic concepts of Linux Distros, package managers, text editors as well as CLI fundamentals, including directory navigation, file/user administration and networking troubleshooting tools. e.g chmod, ping, curl, tcpdump, ping, etc.<br>
● REST API and HTTP Client-Server model and Authentication Protocols<br>
● Version control systems, Git/GitHub: Basic Git concepts: Repository, commit (writing meaningful commit messages), branch, and merge.<br>
● Programming Logic Fundamentals (algorithms, variables, data types, conditionals, loops.)<br>
● TCP/IP and OSI Model Fundamentals, including PDUs and protocols per layer.<br>
● IP Addressing and subnetting fundamentals including IaaS Networking (Google Cloud VPCs) configuration basics and security essentials. e.g firewall rules configuration in Google Cloud Platform and best practices.<br>
● Familiarity with transfer media concepts: Ethernet, Fiber, Wi-Fi IEEE 802.1<br>
● Networking concepts such as: latency, bandwidth, throughput, packets, encapsulation, decapsulation.<br>
● Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals, SaaS | PaaS | IaaS (Resource, Networking and Serverless solution basic concepts.)<br>
● IAM and resource hierarchy in Google Cloud Platform. Access management and role-based permissions.<br>
● Virtualization in Google Cloud Platform (IaaS)<br>
● Basic understanding of container runtime and orchestration with Kubernetes
● Storage offerings in Google Cloud Platform, categories and best use cases. Blobs/Objects, SQL/Nosql DBs,<br>
● Serverless offerings in Google Cloud Platform (PaaS) e.g AppEngine, CloudFunctions<br>
